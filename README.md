## Overview

Worserfish **does not include a graphical user interface** (GUI) that is required
to display a chessboard and to make it easy to input moves. These GUIs are
developed independently from Worserfish and are available online. **Read the
documentation for your GUI** of choice for information about how to use
Worserfish with it.

See also the Stockfish [documentation][wiki-usage-link] for further usage help, as it works the exact same way.

## How it works

Worserfish is based on Stockfish, but tries to lose, assuming his opposent is as well.

It will not just blunder easy mates, but instead will try to force selfmate.

## Files

This distribution of Worserfish consists of the following files:

  * [README.md][readme-link], the file you are currently reading.

  * [Copying.txt][license-link], a text file containing the GNU General Public
    License version 3.

  * [src][src-link], a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a
    Makefile that can be used to compile Stockfish on Unix-like systems.

  * a file with the .nnue extension, storing the neural network for the NNUE
    evaluation. Binary distributions will have this file embedded.

## Contributing

__See [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).__

## Compiling Worserfish

Worserfish has support for 32 or 64-bit CPUs, certain hardware instructions,
big-endian machines such as Power PC, and other platforms.

On Unix-like systems, it should be easy to compile Worserfish directly from the
source code with the included Makefile in the folder `src`. In general, it is
recommended to run `make help` to see a list of make targets with corresponding
descriptions. An example suitable for most Intel and AMD chips:

```
cd src
make -j profile-build
```

Detailed compilation instructions for all platforms can be found in the Stockfish
[documentation][wiki-compile-link]. Their wiki also has information about
the [UCI commands][wiki-uci-link] supported by Worserfish.

## Terms of use

Worserfish is free and distributed under the
[**GNU General Public License version 3**][license-link] (GPL v3). Essentially,
this means you are free to do almost exactly what you want with the program,
including distributing it among your friends, making it available for download
from your website, selling it (either by itself or as part of some bigger
software package), or using it as the starting point for a software project of
your own.

The only real limitation is that whenever you distribute Worserfish in some way,
you MUST always include the license and the full source code (or a pointer to
where the source code can be found) to generate the exact binary you are
distributing. If you make any changes to the source code, these changes must
also be made available under GPL v3.

## Acknowledgements

Worserfish relies heavily on [Stockfish][https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish], which uses neural networks trained on [data provided by the Leela Chess Zero
project][lc0-data-link], made available under the [Open Database License][odbl-link] (ODbL).
